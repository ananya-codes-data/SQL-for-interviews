# ✅ *Core SQL Interview Questions With Answers* 🖥️

1. What is SQL?

- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- You use it to read and manage data in relational databases
- Used in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle

2. What is an RDBMS?

- Relational Database Management System
- Stores data in tables with rows and columns
- Uses keys to link tables

3. What is a table?

- Structured storage for data
- Rows are records
- Columns are attributes
- Example. One row equals one customer

4. What is a primary key?

- Uniquely identifies each row
- Cannot be NULL
- No duplicate values
- Example. user_id in users table

5. What is a foreign key?

- Links one table to another
- Refers to a primary key in another table
- Allows duplicate values
- Example. user_id in orders table

6. Difference between primary key and foreign key

- Primary key ensures uniqueness
- Foreign key ensures relationship
- One table can have one primary key
- One table can have multiple foreign keys

7. What is NULL?

- Represents missing or unknown value
- Not equal to zero or empty string

14. What is GROUP BY?

- Groups rows with same values
- Used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM
- Example: SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department [2]

15. Difference between WHERE and HAVING

- WHERE filters rows before grouping
- HAVING filters groups after GROUP BY
- WHERE can't use aggregates; HAVING can

16. What is a JOIN?

- Combines rows from two or more tables

- INNER JOIN returns matching rows only

17. Types of JOINs?

- INNER JOIN: matching rows
- LEFT JOIN: all from left + matches from right
- RIGHT JOIN: all from right + matches from left
- FULL OUTER JOIN: all from both

18. What are aggregate functions?

- Perform calculations on groups
- COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
- Example: SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees

19. What is a subquery?

- Query inside another query
- Used in SELECT, WHERE, FROM
- Example: SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > (SELECT AVG(age) FROM users)

20. Interview tip you must remember

44. Difference between CTE and Subquery

- CTE reusable within query, more readable
- Subquery embedded, single-use only
- CTEs support recursion;

45. What is a Self Join?

- Join table with itself
- Useful for hierarchical data (manager-employee)
- Example: SELECT e.name, m.name AS manager FROM employees e JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.id;

46. What is LEFT JOIN vs INNER JOIN?

- INNER: only matching rows
- LEFT: all left table + matching right (NULLs for no match)
- Visualize with Venn diagrams;

47. What is a Correlated Subquery?

- Subquery references outer query columns
- Executes once per outer row (slower)
- Example: SELECT name FROM employees e WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = e.department);

48. What does EXISTS do?

- Tests if subquery returns rows
- Faster than IN for large datasets
- Example: SELECT * FROM customers c WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.id);

- Adds new rows to table
- Specify columns or use defaults
- Example: INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES ('Amit', 45000);

52. What is UPDATE statement?

- Modifies existing rows
- Always use WHERE to avoid updating all rows
- Example: UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE department = 'IT';

53. What is DELETE statement?

- Removes rows from table
- WHERE clause critical to avoid data loss
- Example: DELETE FROM orders WHERE status = 'cancelled';

54. What are DML vs DDL?

- DML: Data Manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT)
- DDL: Data Definition (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE)
- DML changes data; DDL changes structure;

55. What is a Clustered Index?

- Determines physical order of data in table
- Only one per table (usually primary key)
- Faster for range scans and sorted queries;

56. What is a Non-Clustered Index?

- Row locks more granular, better concurrency

73. What is Isolation Level?

- Controls transaction visibility
- READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE
- Balance consistency vs performance

74. What is a Temp Table?

- Session-specific table for intermediate results
- #temp in SQL Server, CREATE TEMP TABLE in PostgreSQL
- Faster than CTE for complex multi-step queries

75. What is Table Variable?

- Memory-based, scoped to batch
- @table in SQL Server
- No statistics, good for small datasets

76. What does COALESCE do?

- Returns first non-NULL value
- Alternative to ISNULL
- Example: COALESCE(phone1, phone2, 'No phone')

77. What is NULLIF?

- Returns NULL if equal, else first arg

- RIGHT JOIN: all right + matching left
- FULL OUTER JOIN: all rows from both tables

92. Difference Between INNER vs LEFT JOIN

- INNER: only where join condition matches
- LEFT: all left table rows, NULLs when no right match
- INNER faster, LEFT preserves all source data

93. What is CROSS JOIN?

- Cartesian product (every row × every row)
- No ON condition needed
- Rarely used: 100 customers × 5 products = 500 rows

94. What is SELF JOIN?

- Running totals: SUM() OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
- Moving averages: AVG() OVER (ROWS 7 PRECEDING)

100. Interview tip you must remember

- Draw Venn diagrams for JOIN questions
- Always specify PARTITION BY + ORDER BY for windows
- Test window functions with 5-10 row datasets
- Execution: Window functions after GROUP BY, before ORDER BY
